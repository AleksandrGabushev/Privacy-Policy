# Data Deletion Policy

**Last updated: March 6, 2025**

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Below, we outline how to request deletion of data tied to your device. For details on what data we collect, see our [Privacy Policy](https://dd-digitaldiary.co.in/privacy-policy.html).

## How to Request Data Deletion

1. Open the app.
2. Go to **Settings > Contact Us**.
3. Send us an email with the subject line: **"Delete My Data"**.

The email will **automatically include your UserID** (a unique identifier for your device), which we use to locate and delete your data.

## What Gets Deleted?

- **Deleted:** All data tied to your UserID, including:
  - Approximate geolocation (country-level).
  - Device information (type, OS version).
  - Email correspondence (if you contacted us).

- **Not Deleted:**
  - Data that cannot be linked to your UserID (e.g., aggregated analytics).
  - Subscription data managed by third parties (Apple/Google). Contact them directly.

## Important Notes

- **UserID:** This is a device-specific identifier. We do not know your identity unless you voluntarily share it (e.g., via email).
- **Without UserID:** We cannot process deletion requests, as data is only linked to your device via this identifier.

## Processing Your Request

- Requests are processed within **48 hours**.
- Youâ€™ll receive a confirmation email once completed.
